# BurgerLogger

The burger logger app is essentially an app

 that has a database for information to be 
 updated and stored for the user.

With an option for "devour" and delete.

It takes the info and from the user and dynamically 
adds a burger of the users choice.

This application uses HTML CSS and JAVASCRPT on the front end
and uses node express mysql and handlebars on the back end.
